This demo is based on the `subdomains-poisson` demo from FEniCS. It demonstrates how markers and meshfunctions for both domains and boundaries are used on a very simple 2D geometry.

To run this demo, first run

```python3 create_geometry.py
```

which creates the file `poisson.h5` needed for the demo. Then you can run

```python3 demo_poisson.h5
```

to run the demo.
